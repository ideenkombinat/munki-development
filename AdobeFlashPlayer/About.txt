Some notes on the recipes in this folder:

AdobeFlashPlayer.pkg.recipe

    Downloads the latest Adobe Flash Player installer, and extracts the installer package from inside the Install Adobe Flash Player.app.


AdobeFlashPlayerRepackage.pkg.recipe:

    Downloads the latest Adobe Flash Player installer and creates a new installer pkg, one that installs all required pieces (unlike the embedded package), and one that can be installed on volumes other than the current boot volume. Relies on the current layout and behavior of the Install Adobe Flash Player.app and embedded package (as of Flash Player version 11.8), and is quite likely to break with future releases of Flash Player.


AdobeFlashPlayer.munki.recipe:

    Downloads the latest Adobe Flash Player installer and imports into Munki without modifying the installer; Munki is directed to install the package embedded within the Install Adobe Flash Player.app.


AdobeFlashPlayerExtractPackage.munki.recipe:

    Downloads the latest Adobe Flash Player installer, extracts the embedded package inside Install Adobe Flash Player.app, wraps it in a disk image, and imports it into Munki.


AdobeFlashPlayerRepackage.munki.recipe:

    Repackages the Adobe Flash Player installer as with AdobeFlashPlayerRepackage.pkg.recipe; then imports into Munki. All the same caveats apply.
